# Feed Reader Testing Project
Juan Pablo Eslava

## How to run

Download or clone the game from the project's GitHub repository at (https://github.com/juanpabloeslava/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git).

Once you've done this, just open the **index.html** file using your browser. 

### Test

Several tests to the project were made according to the Project's guide, and can be found on the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js**.

You can run the project without running the tests, to do so, just comment the following line in the `<body>` section within the **index.html** file:

```
<script src="jasmine/spec/feedreader.js"></script>
```
To run the project without seeing the Jasmine test section, also comment or erase the following lines from the `<head>` section in the **index.html** file:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2/jasmine.css">
<script src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2/jasmine.js"></script>
<script src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2/jasmine-html.js"></script>
<script src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2/boot.js"></script>
```
